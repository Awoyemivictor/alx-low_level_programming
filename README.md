ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING

Description
-----------
I just started working at ALX as a Software Engineer, and one of the requirements was that we learn the C programming language. Over the coming months, I'll be using what I've learned to complete what I've learned to complete simple tasks. Aspiring Software Engineers could use this repository as a starting point for their learning.
